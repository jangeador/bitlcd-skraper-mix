# bitlcd-skraper-mix
BitLCD marquee creator for Legends Unchained and the BitLCD in general using Skraper from https://skraper.net

Skraper.net allows for creation of custom Mixes for Image composition. The mixes in this project can be used to generate
custom marquees for the BitLCD.

## Instructions:

Follow the instructions for skraper.net installation. Once you are generating the images, add the preferred marquee as a User Mix. Select a folder for the output and all the marquees will be generated along with the game
